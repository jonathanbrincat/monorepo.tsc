# TSC Monorepo boilerplate

This is a modern monorepo boilerplate for authoring library packages that are in support of a principal web development workstream(including NPM packages for distribution). It is based in Lerna(and nx), supported by TypeScript and compiled with the TypeScript compiler(TSC). Clone it, then develop it in whatever way you see fit and publish it to NPM without the bottlenecks of maintaining separate repositories or integrating GIT submodules.
